I believe the degree of success with the project is 100%.
My approach is to, after copying over the required files, was
to familiarize with fibbonacci program and its requirements 
based on the given C code for the iterative and recursive function.
I then went ahead and started parsing the ifib.asm starter code to see
what I could use from it to build what I needed following the provided
logic in the "A3_Part_Rec_Fib.pdf". With this I was able to set myself
up to the difficult portion of the assignment. I then began to parse the
table provided in "Mic1_Help_basics.pdf" for the syntax in what I need to
do to get the desired recursive implementation and match the sample output
provided in the pdf for the assignment.

It is important to note that the mic1 emulator is simulating a 
16 bit processor, and therefore when displaying values larger 
than signed 16 bits (such as anything between −32,768 to +32,767) the
value would wrap around and be modulo'd with 2^16.
In the case of the fibonacci of 25 in the assignment, the processor
displays a value that has been wrapped around twice since the number was
supposed to be 75,025 but is now only 9,489.
