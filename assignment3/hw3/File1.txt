I believe the degree of success with the project is 100%.
My approach is to, after copying over the required files, was
to familiarize with fibbonacci program and its requirements 
based on the given C code for the iterative and recursive function.
I then went ahead and started parsing the ifib.asm starter code to see
what I could use from it to build what I needed following the provided
logic in the "A3_Part_Rec_Fib.pdf". With this I was able to set myself
up to the difficult portion of the assignment.
