I believe that the degree of success with my project is 100%.
There weren't any problems I was not able to resolve for the
project based off my test cases and the provided ones. 
My approach to the project started off with creating the
boilerplate print out text. I then began to flesh out each
portion of the functions required to print out what was required.
I knew the meat of the operation was actually accounting for
the actual addition of the two floats so I've saved that function
for last. I created a typedef of float_32 to store given floats
into float_1 and float_2 where the underscore represented the change
into the union float_32 defined version for manipulation via 
printing out, or addition when necessary. The only two functions
I created were print_binary and sum_floats because and a lot of
the code was provided in assignment 1 and just required some 
adjustments to be used in assignment 2 for the binary portion.
As for the sum_floats portion, I followed the process on the pdf
document provided to go through the steps of code necessary.
